# Alarm_clock

This is an alarm clock project in which you can set an alarm <br>
--> This is done using datetime module to align with system time and give output when the system time is the alarm time.<br>
--> This uses playsound module to play the alarm when it goes off<br>

## Further updates:

--> usage of CV to play a video when the alarm goes off will be soon added
